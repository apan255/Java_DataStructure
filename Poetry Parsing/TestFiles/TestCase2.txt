True Friends
I
True friends are by your side through it all.
True friends are there to catch you when you fall.
True friends give your life a happy lift.
True friends are a most precious gift.
II
From the day that I first knew you,
Your heart was pure and kind; 
Your smile was sweet and innocent,
Your wit was well refined.
